Question 4:
stdout: This is the standard output that comes from the standard input (stdin) and displays on your terminal without any error.
Example: if you type the ls command, you get what is in the directory as the standard output and you can refer it to another file and display it.

stderr: The standard error is also an output of a command standard input, but the difference is that it shows an error.
Example: writing any unknown command by ubuntu which will display "This command is not found".
